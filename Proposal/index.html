        <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
        <h3>Describe your design</h3>
        <p>My design will be a compilation of projects and assignments I've done for this class, as well as other hobby
            projects such as websites or code.</p>
        <h3>Number of pages in the site</h3>
        <p>I plan to have 1-5 pages depending on how many layers I want the site to have.</p>
        <h3>Rough idea of the content of the pages</h3>
        <p>I plan to have a main page, an about page, a page where I showcase my work, and an image page.</p>
        <h3>Ideas for CSS styling (colors, alignment, etc.)</h3>
        <p>I plan to use Bootstrap to keep everything uniform and looking good. I will also use custom CSS to add my own
            personal touch.</p>
        <h3>Ideas for behavior (JavaScript)</h3>
        <p>I'm considering adding a slideshow of images or projects to the site using JavaScript.</p>
        <h3>Behind-the-scenes organization of your repository</h3>
        <p>I plan to keep everything organized and easy to find by using folders for assets such as images, video, or
            audio if I have any.</p>
        <h3>Identify your primary source(s) of inspiration for the portfolio design</h3>
        <p>My primary source of inspiration will be my own works, as well as other websites that I like.</p>
